# Introduce
This is a 'shell', to simulate a linux terminal
# Errors
If you see the Traceback or any unexpected error, please send an email to me.<a href="mailto:rsboss01@outlook.com?subject=Error report.">, and please give me the log files. These thing is in /proc folder. You should send ".ohsh_history" and "log.conf". You can also send a zip file including this entire software.
# Credential
Username is 'root', you can change this in this shell: sudo user
Password is blank, you shouldn't enter anything.
# Commands
shutdown: Shutdown Shell.

passwd: Change password.

reboot: Reboot Shell.

browser: Request a web page.

user: Change username.

switchuser: Switch user.

sudo : Sudo mode. e.g. sudo passwd  (Change root's password)

# Cautions
/proc is temporary files, but you shouldn't delete them.

/tmp is temporary files too, you can delete them.

/etc is system files, if you delete them, the program will crash immediately.
